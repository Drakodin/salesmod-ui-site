<h2>Web Components</h2>
<p>But wait! Why this? Simple.</p>
<p>In the typical case, most component-based websites are locked to a specific framework that lets someone make their own. Not only that, it is not that easy to keep reusing code in just raw HTML projects.</p>
<p>That is where Web Components come in and why we chose to make a near universally supported library for all potential users. We know that reusing blocks is hard and web compoents solves this by allowing us to define our own blocks, power a &quot;shadow&quot; DOM which renders elements separately from the document itself, and allow us to use templates that can reused countless times.</p>
<p>Plus, they are not limited to just files. These are browser-end supports, not your framework. So whether you are using React or Liquid, these components can be added to your preference.</p>
<h2>Salesmod</h2>
<p>Hi from the author of this library! We aim to provide small e-commerce stores with a commercial-level recommender system. Just use our components in your site (future CSS updates coming to allow customizability) and include our scripts and that's it! On this site, you can see our current project status and how each of our components look and feel. Thank you so much and I hope you choose to use our library in the future.</p>
